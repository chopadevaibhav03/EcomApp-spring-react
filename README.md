# EcomApp

This project is a learning and practice application using the Spring Framework and React. The primary goal is to explore how e-commerce applications work. 

## Overview

In this project, I utilized:

- **Spring Framework** for the backend
- **React** for the frontend
- **H2 Database** with JPQL queries for data management

The application performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and includes a feature to search for products.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Add, update, delete, and view products.
- **Product Search**: Search for products to see if they exist in the database.
- **Design Patterns**: Implemented various design patterns to enhance the structure and maintainability of the application.
- **Annotations**: Leveraged annotations to simplify configuration and dependency injection in Spring.
- **JDBC**: Used JDBC for database interactions.
- **H2 Console**: Integrated H2 console for easy database management and query execution.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout this project, I learned:

- The practical application of design patterns in software development.
- How to effectively use annotations in Spring.
- Working with JDBC for database connectivity.
- Managing and querying the H2 database using the H2 console.

This project serves as a small module of an e-commerce application and demonstrates essential features typically found in such systems.
